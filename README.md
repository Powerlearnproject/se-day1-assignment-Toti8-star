#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products. It's role in tech industry enables the creation of software applications and systems that powers all facets of life in this digital age.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: collecting document needs and system requirements.
- Design:Creating qood quality designs of user interface
- Implementation: Writing the code and building the software
- Testing: conducting tests to ensure it is standardized and functional
- Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
- Maintenance: Providing ongoing updates and enhancements to the software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: is an approach following a particular order like a waterfall.for example the software development Life Cycle.
Agile: It is a flexible approach thhat easily can change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  - System Architect: Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.
  - UI/UX Designer: Creates user interfaces and designs user experiences for software applications.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debuggin and testing i.e. visual studio
-VCS Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
- Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: These are effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 Importance of Testing: Testing is a critical aspect of QA and involves various types of testing, including:
  - Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-It is how to give instructions or a set of commands/questions to AI that it does exactly what we want.
-The importance is to get a clear and best responce to your prompt


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: 'how many butterflies exist?"
clear prompt: 'how many species of butterflies exists and what are their specific characteristics?'
